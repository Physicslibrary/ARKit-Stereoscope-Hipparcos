Apple has updated iOS Swift Playgrounds 3.0 on May 14, 2019. There is now a simple way to turn off Swift Playgrounds logging every objects created during runtime (little boxes that appears on the right side when "Run My Code", useful for inspection and debugging but consume memory).

In Swift Playgrounds 3.0, a "Blank Swift 5.0 Edition" template will have a switch for turning off logging. Now Playgrounds can add much more objects to a scene!
